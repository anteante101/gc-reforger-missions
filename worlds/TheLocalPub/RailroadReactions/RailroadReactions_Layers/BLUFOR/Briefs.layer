  "<h2>LORE</h2>"\
  "A Russian train with troops and equipment has been forced into retreat following the loss of control in the surrounding region. During its withdrawal, the train was ambushed by partisan resistance forces, who sabotaged the rail line and caused a derailment."\
  ""\
  "The ambush was not intended to destroy the force outright, but to delay and fix it in place. Resistance elements remain active in the area conducting harassment attacks and observing the stranded troops. The derailment has also drawn the attention of US forces, which are now advancing toward the site to exploit the situation and prevent an organized withdrawal."\
  ""\
  "Russian troops on the ground are isolated and operating with limited mobility. Reinforcements have been requested, but their arrival is uncertain. Until relief arrives, the derailed train and surrounding terrain must be held under increasing pressure."

  "Enemy forces consist of approximately 20 Russian troops from the 275th Motor Rifle Regiment. Their train was derailed at GRID: 064059 with assistance from friendly INDFOR partisan forces."\
  "Partisan reporting indicates the locomotive has been destroyed. The enemy has sustained casualties in the crash and appears to be establishing a hasty defensive position while awaiting relief."\
  "The nearest known enemy unit is the 278th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, located approximately 5 km to our south. They are assessed as the most likely force to respond and attempt extraction of the surviving troops."\
  "<h2>STRENGTHS, CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS</h2> "\
  "• The train is armed. Partisan forces report a ZU-23 positioned at both the front and rear of the train. Several carriages contain fortified fighting positions, including static machine gun emplacements."\
  "• Although time is limited, the Russians will use every available moment to establish defensive positions, set kill zones, clear fields of fire, and prepare delay and fallback positions."\
  "• Enemy forces are currently dismounted. One flank of their position is fully exposed due to the adjacent lake, limiting concealed maneuver options on that side. "\
  ""\
  "<h2>SERVICE & SUPPORT</h2> "\
  "• The train was transporting heavy and light weapons, equipment, and supplies. With withdrawal no longer possible, these resources are expected to be used to reinforce their defensive posture and delay our assault."

  ""\
  "<h2>STRENGTHS, CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS</h2> "\
  "• We do <b>not</b> possess the capability to defeat a reinforcing enemy relief force. Speed and decisive action are critical."\
  "• We have freedom of movement within the AO aside from the known enemy presence. The area is otherwise uncontested, and the target unit is assessed to be isolated, allowing easier positioning with minimal resistance."\
  "• The platoon is fully mobile, with sufficient vehicles to allow each callsign to operate either mounted or dismounted as required."\
  "• The east side of the train is dominated by a large open swamp with minimal cover or concealment. The terrain is shallow and trafficable by both foot and vehicle, with multiple small low-lying islands throughout."\

  "• HQ Squad: 1x M2 (.50 cal) armed Humvee and 2x unarmed Humvees."\
