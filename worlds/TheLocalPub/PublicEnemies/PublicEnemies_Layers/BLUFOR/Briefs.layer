  "DTL: 22/07/1945, 2000hr, Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin"\
  "Weather: Clear and dry with no forecast of change. Sightlines 1km+"\
  "Terrain: Multiple shallow fords located throughout the river marked with yellow, patchey open fields tyically with deep running ditches alongside and dense woodblock with scattered treelines, many dotted hamlets and towns throughout."\

  "<h2>LORE</h2>"\
  "In post-war America, two rival outfits — the Brown Suited Bashers and the Grey Suited Grapplers — have agreed to meet and settle their differences. The sit-down is scheduled at a secluded retreat known as Bohemian Lodge, far from prying eyes and city streets soaked in turf wars."\
  "But peace does not serve everyone."\
  "Certain corrupt federal agents have their own interests in keeping the conflict alive. A truce would disrupt their leverage, their influence, and the profits drawn from a divided underworld."\
  "As both crews arrive expecting negotiation, unseen forces prepare to intervene."\
  "Will peace be brokered or will the feds ensure the war continues?"

  ""\
  "<b>Composition</b>"\
  "Enemy forces consist of two established organized crime groups known as the Brown Suited Bashers and the Grey Suited Grapplers. Both outfits are well-financed, motivated, and structured criminal enterprises with influence across multiple cities within the United States."\
  "An informant provided intelligence via a dead drop, indicating approximately 20 personnel are present at the meeting location, with no civilians in attendance."\
  ""\
  "<b>Disposition</b>"\
  "Both organizations are scheduled to meet at Little Bohemian Lodge (GRID: 027010), a secluded and defensible hamlet. The location offers controlled access points, natural cover, and is flanked by a river, making it well suited for security and defensive operations."\
  ""\
  "<h2>Strengths & Capabilities</h2>"\
  "• Our informant reports that both mobs are well armed, carrying a range of weapons including automatic submachine guns, semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, handguns, and improvised firebombs.  "\
  "• They arrived in standard civilian vehicles, which are neither armed nor up-armoured.  "\
  "• Little Bohemian Lodge offers strong defensive potential, with high hedgerows, perimeter fencing, a flanking river, and elevated structures providing concealment, cover, and advantageous fields of fire, making it well suited for close-in defense.  "\
  ""\
  "<b>MLCO:</b> The mobs are expected to deploy sentries and conduct patrols around the compound while maintaining security and awaiting contact.  "\
  ""\
  "<b>MDCO:</b> Likely to isolate elements of our force from mutual support by fixing a callsign in position, then gradually attriting them until combat ineffective."

  "Our force consists of 28 corrupt federal officers with significant interests at stake should the mobsters succeed in making peace."\

  "<b>Disposition</b>"\
  "Our disposition is dependent on the chosen insertion location(s)."\
  "From the staging area, we have the ability to deploy via the red or green doors to either the northern insert (GRID: 034019) or the southern insert (GRID: 022003) once the 60-second setup timer has expired."\
  ""\
  "<h2>Strengths & Capabilities</h2>"\
  "• Each insert location provides 7 unarmed civilian vehicles. The southern insert also includes 2 boats positioned on the river.  "\
  "- There is a ford between us and the objective. We can cross this with the boats if we go full speed over it. No damage taken."\
  "• We have full freedom of movement. No other hostile elements are present in the area, and the surrounding terrain is civilian in nature, aside from the lodge itself.  "\
  "• Personnel are equipped with automatic submachine guns, semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns."
